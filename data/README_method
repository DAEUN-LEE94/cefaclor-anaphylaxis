Pathway-level enrichment was assessed using pre-ranked gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), implemented via the Broad Instituteâ€™s GSEA software (v4.3.2). A ranked gene list was generated by ordering genes based on the lowest p-value from the association analysis. In cases where multiple variants mapped to the same gene, only the variant with the smallest p-value was used to represent that gene in the ranked list. Enrichment analysis was performed using the Hallmark gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB v2023.2). Default parameters were applied, including 1,000 permutations, a weighted enrichment statistic, and gene set size filters ranging from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 500 genes. Nominal p-values were used to evaluate enrichment, and gene sets with p < 0.05 were considered suggestively enriched.
